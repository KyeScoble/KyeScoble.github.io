      <h2>Interests in Information Technology</h2>
      <h4>- What is your interest in IT?</h4>
      <P1>I am interested in IT as I enjoy designing and programming a variety of applications as well as how it has a high percentage of problem solving which can be challenging and exciting. I am interested in being involved with the development of things such as applications, games and technology. I am interested in IT as it has so many possibilities of what can be developed and how it is now a part of everyone’s everyday life.</P1>
      <h4>- When did your interest in IT start?</h4>
      <P1>I have been using technology since I was a child, I started by playing video games which then towards the end of primary school became an interest in making programs. During high school I found that the classes I enjoyed the most were my IT classes. I took many IT classes which were my favourite and the classes I could concentrate the most in.</P1>
      <h4>- Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</h4>
      <P1>My interest in IT grew over time from playing video games, learning how to use computers, taking many classes and playing many sports that lead to me having found an interest in computers and designing programs and games.</P1>
      <h4>- Outline your IT experience (if any):</h4>
      <P1>I have taken classes in Computing, Games Development, Robotics, VCE 1/2 Computing, VCE 3/4 Software Development and Systems Engineering. These are all classes I took at high school and learned to program, design and build IT systems.</P1>
      <h4>- Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h4>
      <P1>I chose to go to RMIT because it was highly recommended to me by family and friends. After going to the open days, I enjoyed seeing the facilities and thought that RMIT’s location was convenient and would make life easier if I had easy access to shops, home and school. After sitting in on course lectures for each of my university options I found that I believed RMIT was best for me and my learning style.</P1>
      <h4>- What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h4>
      <P1>I am expecting to learn more programming techniques, how to work in groups for IT and an understanding of how IT businesses/jobs work and their processes. I hope to develop my oral presentation skills and team work. I also hope to fully figure out what I would like as a future job.</P1>

<div class="Project" id="Project">
      <h2>Project Idea</h2>
      <p1> Texty Text Text .</p1>
      <h4>Overview:</h4>
      <p1>Using a Virtual Reality headset to help strengthen a person’s amblyopia (lazy eye) and  strabismus (Cross-eyes)  as well as help strengthen a user’s weaker eye by having multiple exercises/games that display separate images on each screen to increase the use of the user’s weaker eye while the stronger eye has to assist. This is working towards the eyes working together rather than one being shut out more than the other.</p1>
      <img src="Images/oculus.jpeg" width = 300px heigh = 300px>
      <h4>Motivation:</h4>
      <p1>I just found this idea to be interesting after my optometrist told me about how VR is being used to treat people and help people. After hearing how places are working on this idea I wanted to look into, yet this treatment has not been implemented in most places due to the cost of a VR headset. I wanted to look into ways to make it cheaper, which is becoming more possible with headsets such as the Oculus go and gear VR, which don’t require a computer. I also hope for VR to grow into a much larger community as there are so many possibilities for VR to grow into.</p1>
      <h4>Description:</h4>
      <p1>An application for multiple types of VR headsets that has multiple exercises to help strengthen the user’s weaker eye. This can be does through exercises that require the weaker eye to work harder and complete exercises, while the stronger eye assists. This can be done by making the screen brighter for the weaker eye so the brain focuses on it more and dull the screen for the stronger eye so it is being focused on less.</p1>
      <h4>Tools and Technologies:</h4>
      <li>A VR headset</li>
      <li>A computer (Depending on headset type)</li>
      <li>A phone (Depending on headset type)</li>
      <h4>Skills Required:</h4>
      <li>An understanding on how a VR headset works</li>
      <li>Ability to program</li>
      <li>Understanding of the human eye with connection to the brain</li>
      <h4>Feasibility:</h4>
      <p1>This project would be possible as it has been successful at other places which have implemented it. the UVEA clinic in Martin, northern Slovakia, has treated 300 people since 2015, previous treatments showed hope for improvement for children under 7, however wasn’t effective for adults. This new treatment they put in place using VR has shown hope for improvement for many people. However, this treatment is not being widely used as VR can be quite costly. So, I hope to find ways to make this more affordable and efficient. </p1>
      <h4>Outcome:</h4>
      <p1>If this project was successful it could lead to more accessible treatment for people with amblyopia and  strabismus, as optometrists could implement this technology into their offices with less cost and difficulty. This could also lead to a growth in VR applications and development teams as people begin to learn more about the possibility’s VR holds.</p1>
